Synthetic Data Generation using GANs for Privacy-Preserving and Data Augmentation  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
PixelForge is a deep learning project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for medical image classification and augmentation.  
The project is tested on the **C-NMC Leukemia Dataset (ALL vs Normal cells)**.

### ðŸ”¹ Stage 1
- Built a baseline CNN classifier.
- Achieved **84% accuracy** and **0.90 ROC-AUC**.
- High recall for Leukemia cases (95%) â€“ critical for medical diagnosis.

### ðŸ”¹ Stage 2
- Use GANs to generate synthetic cell images.
- Retrain CNN with augmented dataset.
- Evaluate performance improvement.
